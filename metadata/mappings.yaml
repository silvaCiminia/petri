# Metadata mapping
# Entries must be formatted as follows:
#
# PythonClassName0:
#   db_class: DbClassName
#   py_property0: db_property0
#   py_property1: db_property1
#   .
#   .
#   .
# PythonClassName1:
#   .
#   .
#   .
#
# Example:
#
# SampleClass:
#   ^--Python class name, case-sensitive. Required for all items.
#
#   db_class: DbSampleClass
#               ^--Name of the matching db type in the entities file. If not
#                provided, we will attempt to find a type in the entities file
#                that matches the python class name
#
#   py_property0: db_property0
#                   ^--Mapping of python object properties to db object
#                    properties. If a property is not included in this metadata,
#                    we will try to match it to a db object property by name.
#                    All python object properties (other than id) must be
#                    matched in one of these two ways.

db_name: 'petriDB' # Required. Can be an absolute path

Session:
  # Required session object
  db_class: Session
  skip: [item_dict]
  name: name

PetriClass:
  db_class: Entity
